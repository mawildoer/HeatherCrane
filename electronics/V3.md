# Electronics Version 3 Notes

For some unknown reason (though potentially over-voltage or poor soldering, dynamic loading), the V2 electronics repeatedly blew chips which were theoretically protected from all faults we could throw at it. This has caused the repeated destruction of the microcontrollers and buck convertors

We are designing custom H-bridge circuits to replace these.

Requirements:
 - constant 30A+ capacity
 - safe 6S (25.2V)+ operation
 - over-temp protection <- NTC + comparator, microcontroller
 - over-current protection <- low side shunt + microcontroller, comparator
 - shoot-through protection <- logic + timing + comparator, microcontroller
 - LV protection <- current limiting resistors + shunt diodes

Wants:
 - i2c control (+$0.00) <- microcontroller ([ATtiny44a (Arduino Compatible)](https://www.digikey.com.au/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATTINY44A-SSUR/ATTINY44A-SSURCT-ND/3441005))
 - bus voltage monitoring (+$0.10) <- bus (i2c) + voltage divider
 - current feedback (+$0.00) <- bus (i2c)
 - reverse polarity protection
 - no heatsink for 30A operation <- low Rds on FETs
 - LV isolation (+$4.40) <- dedicated isolator ([SI8602](https://www.digikey.com.au/product-detail/en/silicon-labs/SI8602AC-B-IS/336-2050-5-ND/2623285))

The i2c bus isolation is extremely expensive and give the lack of genuinely large voltages in the system, redundant.
